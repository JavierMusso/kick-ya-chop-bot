Well, this is a small project I wanted to try. This is not my first bot, but the first one to upload.

I'm pretty happy with the outcome, as it only took a few hours. Altough, it doesn't go over 400 or so, my look at it later :p

Done using only pixel values, since template matching was a bit overkill for this.

This is the game: https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/kick-ya-chop

A side note, it only works on my screen size, 1920x1080. Didn't really feel like spending more time on that.
